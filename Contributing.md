How to Contribute
=================

Start
-----

To start developing Flappy SVG, there is a variety of repeatable [tasks](tasks#tasks) for you and one time [Issues](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues) you can solve.

Hints
-----

- You should add your name with a link to your website to the [credits.html](http://fossasia.github.io/flappy-svg/credits.html).
- Have a look at the [implementation hints](./hints).
- When you claim an issue, you need to comment. We can not let you do all the [easy](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy+label%3Agci) issues because they are for people who first contribute to the project, unless we have a lot of them.
- Create [new branches](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for pull requests if you do several pull requests or issues at a time, so they can be reviewed independently.
- If reasonable, each issue should have an own pull request.
- You can add issues yourself if you want specific improvements of the game. We categorize them into `easy`, `middle` and `hard`.
- All works must be your own creation or you must give proper, license-dependent attribution to the creator. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file and [credits.html](http://fossasia.github.io/flappy-svg/credits.html).
- This must work online and offline and without internet connection.
- This all is possible to be discussed.
