**Description**

The game [Flappy-SVG](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg#flappy-svg) can be customized using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and Javascript. 
Add your favorite background to it.

**Requirements:**

- If not done already, download and install [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/).
- Edit the file and add a new background layer to it. It MUST be your own creation. You can transform existing figures, into SVG like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPHrmw4r16o).
- You should reduce the size of the SVG if you use the clone functionality (Alt+D) instead of copy or duplicate(Ctrl+D), second menu in the middle.
- While creating the game you may have ideas for improvement - add them as [github issue](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues).
- create a pull request

**Expected Outcome:** 

- The background is licensed under Creative Commons
- a pull request that is merged
- All issues resulting from your pull-request are resolved.
- Your name should be in the [credits.html](http://fossasia.github.io/flappy-svg/credits.html) file - preferably with a link to your website.
