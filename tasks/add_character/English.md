**Description**

The game [Flappy-SVG](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg#flappy-svg) can be customized using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and Javascript.
Add your favorite character to it.

**Requirements:**

- If not done already, download and install [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/).

- Use a new layer for your character!
- While creating the game you may have ideas for improvement - add them as [github issue](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues).

**Expected Outcome:** 

- A new character that can be reached by clicking on the existing characters
- The character is licensed under Creative Commons
- a pull request that is merged
