**Description**

The game [Flappy-SVG](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg#flappy-svg) can be customized using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and Javascript. 
Create issues for your ideas of the game and help others to solve them. Do not solve them yourself.

**Requirements:**

1. Do not claim this task.
2. Create at least one [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues) that describes your idea very precisely, gives hints, links, context. The more issues the likelier others are interested.
3. We will review the issue, suggest improvements and tag it. If it is too big we will split it. Easy tasks are for beginners.
4. Wait.
5. Someone else wants to solve this issue. You instead of mentors help this person to resolve the issue. Mentors are allowd to help.  Do not do the work for this person. Do not keep too much to your idea. Now it is the idea of both of you and together you could create something cool.
6. Test and review the code of the other person, then notify the mentors e.g. @niccokunzmann that it is ready for merge into the main branch of the game.
7. If merged, we will review if you were an OK mentor and tell you to claim this task.

**Expected Outcome:** 

- You did experience what it means to be 'on the other side of the project' - being like a mentor. 
- The issue is resolved, or we can see the other person abandoned the task but you gave your best.
- Your name should be in the [credits.html](http://fossasia.github.io/flappy-svg/credits.html) file - preferably with a link to your website.
