How to Contribute
=================

- You should add your name with a link to your website to the [Contributors.md](./Contributors.md).
- Have a look at the [implementation hints](./hints).
- When you claim an issue, you need to comment. We can not let you do all the [easy](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy+label%3Agci) issues because they are for people who first contribute to the project, unless we have a lot of them.
- Create [new branches](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for pull requests if you do several pull requests or issues at a time, so they can be reviewed independently.
- If reasonable, each issue should have an own pull request.
- You can add issues yourself if you want specific improvements of the game. We categorize them into `easy`, `middle` and `hard`.
- When the issue is tagged as [GCI](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/labels/GCI), it is possible to solve google codein tasks with it. 
- This all is possible to be discussed.
